## Week 4

**Zoom Link:** [https://ualberta-ca.zoom.us/j/97755262261](https://ualberta-ca.zoom.us/j/97755262261)

This week we're talking about data visualization. We'll be using the same dataset from last week (week 3), but this week we'll be using our first *package*. To facilitate our plotting, we'll be using the `ggplot2` package which is a component of the `tidyverse`. To save time during the session, please install the `tidyverse` on your computer prior to the session by running the following code:

`install.packages('tidyverse')`

This code will ensure that the tidyverse is loaded in your computer and ready for use during the session.

### Principles of Data Visualization

We won't dedicate much time to the discussion of visualization more theoretically, but there exists a wide array of literature on optimizing the communication of a scientific message through plots and graphs. We've put some links to some more resources on  data visualization in the [Resources](/Resources/) tab if you are curious.

In this video Cole will discuss some of the high level keys to good data visualization that we would like you to keep in mind as we go through the practical aspects of coding your visualization in R.
