## RStudio & General Helpful Links:

Some helpful tips & tricks to work more effectively in [RStudio](https://towardsdatascience.com/tips-and-tricks-in-rstudio-and-r-markdown-7a464508b0c)

Possibly the most useful resource, the [Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com) is a comprehensive collection of books about/for/involving/referencing R, and includes everything from the basics to in-depth full volumes on dynamic programming in R

## Packages -- To use Base or Tidy (or data.table)?

There are a million discussions on whether or not to use Base R or TidyR. Keep in mind that a lot of these are written by the people who work at RStudio, who are amazing and do great work in R education, but also are the ones who built and maintain the tidyverse, so the opinion you will get from them should be interpreted with that in mind. Here's a [good even-handed discussion](https://wetlandscapes.com/blog/a-comparison-of-r-dialects/) of the various merits, but also more importantly a comparison of the different ways to do things.

My favourite [blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/12/why-i-dont-use-the-tidyverse/) on why to use Base R. I (Cole) used to be an *ardent* believer in the Tidyverse, and I still use it for most of my day to day work, but this blog convinced me to think about teaching Base R (as Emma originally suggested) and I think there are some great points made here.

For the sake of even-handedness, here is a [blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/09/why-learn-the-tidyverse/#:~:text=Why%20is%20Tidyverse%20so%20popular,build%20an%20ecosystem%20of%20applications.) that believes Tidyverse is the way to go.
