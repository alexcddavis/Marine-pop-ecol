# Population Modeling Assignment Overview

Population models can take many forms, but with populations we classify as age/stage-structured, building models to explicitly account for those stages is helpful. The purpose of this assignment is to introduce you to modeling stage-structured populations in the form of matrix models. This assignment has two parts. Part 1 walks you through a series of guided questions to get your feet wet with stage-structured models as we discussed in class. Part 2 requires you to do research on your own and build a small matrix model with accompanying write up. Note that part 1 of this assignment borrows from materials developed by Dr. Marin Krko≈°ek's Population Ecology course held at the University of Toronto. 

## Part 1 - Northern Right Whale

The northern right whale (*Eubalaena glacialis*) is one of the most critically endangered cetacean species on the planet. Previously very abundant, they suffered massive population decline as a result of over-harvesting in the 19th century. They have been of interest from a conservation perspective for decades, and in a widely-cited paper, [Fujiwara & Casswell (Nature 2001)](https://www.nature.com/articles/35107054) estimated their demographic rates and built a matrix model for the species. 

The life-cycle graph for the female whales is considered here:
