# Population Modeling Assignment Overview

Population models can take many forms, but with populations we classify as age/stage-structured, building models to explicitly account for those stages is helpful. The purpose of this assignment is to introduce you to modeling stage-structured populations in the form of matrix models. This assignment has two parts. Part 1 walks you through a series of guided questions to get your feet wet with stage-structured models as we discussed in class. Part 2 requires you to do research on your own and build a small matrix model with accompanying write up. 

## Part 1 - Northern Right Whale

The northern right whale is one of the most critically endangered cetacean species on the planet.
