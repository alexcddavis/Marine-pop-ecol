# Marine Population Ecology & Dynamics 

Website and repository for the Fall 2021 Marine Population Ecology Course as taught by Dr Alex Davis at the [Bamfield Marine Science Centre.](https://www.bamfieldmsc.com/education/prospective-students/courses/detail/marine-population-ecology-dynamics) 

Course material is hosted here and on Github Classroom. The course materials will continue to be openly accessible and available for re-use with credit according to the licence here. 

## Why is this Course being hosted on GitHub? 

Two reasons: 

1. **Education shouldn't be proprietary.** This repository, in it's open format, provides a completely open and accessible platform for anyone with an internet connection to access the content of this course. 
2. **It forces you to practice using version control at least a little bit every day.** The only way to learn a new tool is to use it. That's why we host all the materials (even ones that might not traditionally be held on a repository/website like this) here, so that each day, to access the course material and submit/work on assignments, you get some practice interacting with Git/GitHub.
